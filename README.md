## Getting the Repository

You have **two ways** to get this repository on your computer.

---

## Option 1: Download ZIP (No Git knowledge required)

This option is suitable if you only want to **view the files**, but it is **NOT recommended** because you cannot easily update later.

1. Open the repository:
   [https://github.com/QuyenNV-Hanu/S2026](https://github.com/QuyenNV-Hanu/S2026)
2. Click **Code → Download ZIP**
3. Extract the ZIP file on your computer

⚠️ You will need to download again every time there is an update.

---

## Option 2: Clone the Repository (RECOMMENDED ✅)

Cloning allows you to **pull the latest updates at any time** and get familiar with GitHub workflows.

### Step 1: Install Git

#### Windows

* Download Git from: [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
* Install using default settings

#### macOS

```bash
brew install git
```

(Requires Homebrew)

Or install Git from:
[https://git-scm.com/download/mac](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

---

### Step 2: Clone the Repository

Open **Terminal / Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuyenNV-Hanu/S2026.git
```

This will create a folder named `S2026` on your computer.

---

### Step 3: Navigate to the Repository

```bash
cd S2026
```

You can now open the folder using your IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.).

---

## Pulling Latest Updates (VERY IMPORTANT)

During the semester, the instructor will **continuously add or update demo examples**.

To get the latest changes:

```bash
git pull
```

✅ Run this command **every week** or **before each lab/tutorial session**.

---

## Why We Use GitHub in This Course

Using GitHub helps you:

* Work with **version control systems (VCS)** used in real software projects
* Understand **collaboration workflows**
* Manage code updates efficiently
* Prepare for **internships and real-world development environments**

You are **not required to push code** unless instructed, but you are expected to:

* Clone the repository
* Pull updates regularly
* Explore the demo examples

---

## Final Notes

* Always pull the latest version before starting your work
* Do not modify instructor files unless instructed
* If you encounter Git errors, ask during lab sessions

📌 **This repository is your main source for PR2 and SE2 demo materials throughout S2026.**
